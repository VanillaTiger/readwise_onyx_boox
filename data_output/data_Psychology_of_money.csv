Reading Notes | <<Morgan Housel - The Psychology of Money_ Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness-Harriman House Limited (2020)>>Morgan HouselYou know stuff about money that I don’t, and vice versa. You go through life with different beliefs, goals, and forecasts, than I do. That’s not because one of us is smarter than the other, or has better information. It’s because we’ve had different lives shaped by different and equally persuasive experiences.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;stuff about money;21;2023.07.22 11:06
We all think we know how the world works. But we’ve all only experienced a tiny sliver of it.As investor Michael Batnick says, “some lessons have to be experienced before they can be understood.” We are all victims, in differentways, to that truth.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;only experienced tiny bit;22;2023.07.22 11:10
The economists found that people’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation—especially experiences early in their adult life;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;experience based decision;23;2023.07.22 11:13
If you grew up when inflation was high, you invested less of your money in bonds later in life compared to those who grew up when inflation was low. If you happened to grow up when the stock marketwas strong, you invested more of your money in stocks later in life compared to those who grew up when stocks were weak;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;inflation and stock market;23;2023.07.22 11:14
The economists wrote: “Our findings suggest that individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.”Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck ofwhen and where you were born.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;personal history;23;2023.07.22 11:14
Every decision people make with money is justified by taking the information they have at the moment and plugging it into their unique mental model of how the world works.Those people can be misinformed. They can have incomplete information. They can be bad at math. They can be persuaded by rotten marketing. They can have no idea what they’re doing. They can misjudge the consequences of their actions. Oh, can they ever;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;pludging into mental model;27;2023.07.22 11:22
1. No One’s CrazyFew people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. Theymake them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;narrative that works for you;29;2023.07.22 11:27
the backbone savings vehicle of American retirement—did not exist until 1978. The Roth IRA was not born until 1998. If it were a person it would be barely old enough to drink.It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;we all are newbies;31;2023.07.22 11:31
We all do crazy stuff with money, because we’re all relatively new to this game and what looks crazy to you might make sense to me. But no one is crazy—we all make decisions based on our own unique experiences that seem to make sense to us in a given moment.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;crazy stuff;32;2023.07.22 11:35
2. Luck & RiskLuck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guidedby forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside ofyour control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;luck and risk;38;2023.07.22 11:49
Say I buy a stock, and five years later it’s gone nowhere. It’s possible that I made a bad decision by buying it in the first place. It’s also possible that I made a good decision that had an 80% chance of making money, and I just happened to end up on the side of the unfortunate 20%. How do I know which is which? Did I make a mistake, or did I just experience the reality of risk?It’s possible to statistically measure whether some decisions were wise. But in the real world, day to day, we simply don’t. It’s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy but often devilishly misleading.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;risk or mistake;40;2023.07.22 11:53
He did, and it worked. But it’s easy to imagine those being the last words of a story with a very different outcome. The line between bold and reckless can be thin. When we don’t give risk and luck their proper billing it’s often invisible;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;bold vs reckless;43;2023.07.22 12:00
We similarly think Mark Zuckerberg is a genius for turning down Yahoo!’s 2006 $1 billion offer to buy his company. He saw the future andstuck to his guns. But people criticize Yahoo! with as much passion for turning down its own big buyout offer from Microsoft—those fools should have cashed out while they could! What is the lesson forentrepreneurs here? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard to pin down;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;unknown lesson;43;2023.07.22 12:02
But two things can point you in a better direction. Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look downupon and wish to avoid becoming.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;be careful;44;2023.07.22 12:04
Some people are born into families that encourage education, others are against it. Some are born into flourishing economies encouraging of entrepreneurship, others are born into war and destitution. I wantyou to be successful, and I want you to earn it. But realize that not allsuccess is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;but realize;44;2023.07.22 12:05
Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;focus patterns;44;2023.07.22 12:06
Studying a specific person can be dangerous because we tend to study extreme examples—the billionaires, the CEOs, or the massive failures that dominate the news—and extreme examples are often the least applicable to other situations, given their complexity. The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons toyour own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;specific examples;45;2023.07.22 12:07
The trick when dealing with failure is arranging your financial life in a way that a bad investmenthere and a missed financial goal there won’t wipe you out so you cankeep playing until the odds fall in your favor;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;playing the odds;46;2023.07.22 12:09
But more important is that as much as we recognize the role of luck in success, the role of risk means we should forgive ourselves and leave room for understanding when judging failures.Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;nothing is as good and as bad;46;2023.07.22 12:10
3. Never EnoughAt a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history. Heller responds, “Yes, but I have something he will never have … enough.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;enough;49;2023.07.22 13:59
To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’thave and don’t need;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;plain foolish;53;2023.07.22 14:09
Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. Perhaps they go hand in hand, wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But life isn’t any fun without a sense of enough. Happiness, as it’s said, is just results minus expectations;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;enough;54;2023.07.22 14:11
The idea of having “enough” might look like conservatism, leaving opportunity and potential on the table.I don’t think that’s right.“Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;idea of enough, regret;55;2023.07.22 14:14
There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potentialgain;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;neverworth;56;2023.07.22 14:15
Reputation is invaluable.Freedom and independence are invaluable.Family and friends are invaluable.Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;invaluable;56;2023.07.22 14:16
4. Confounding CompoundingBut good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t berepeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;good investing;66;2023.07.22 14:34
5. Getting Wealthy vs. Staying WealthyThere are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so.But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;staying wealthy;69;2023.07.22 14:35
Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;getting vs keeping;72;2023.07.22 14:41
Here again, survival.Not “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around for along time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;survival;73;2023.07.22 14:43
More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;financially unbreakable;75;2023.07.22 14:46
if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;compounding;76;2023.07.22 14:47
It’s different from being conservative. Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. Its magic is that the higher your margin of safety, the smaller your edge needs to be to have a favorable outcome;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;margin of safety;77;2023.07.22 14:52
A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;paranoic optimism;77;2023.07.22 14:53
The idea that something can gain over the long run while being a basketcase in the short run is not intuitive, but it’s how a lot of thingswork in life. By age 20 the average person can lose roughly half the synaptic connections they had in their brain at age two, as inefficientand redundant neural pathways are cleared out. But the average 20-year-old is much smarter than the average two-year-old. Destruction in the face of progress is not only possible, but an efficient way to get rid of excess;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;destruction in the face of progress;78;2023.07.22 14:55
6. Tails, You WinThe great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;art like funds;85;2023.07.22 20:19
That can be hard to deal with, even if you understand the math. It is not intuitive that an investor can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;you can fail half of a time and be good;85;2023.07.22 20:20
Anything that is huge, profitable, famous, or influential is the result of a tail event—an outlying one-in-thousands or millions event. And most of our attention goes to things that are huge, profitable, famous,or influential. When most of what we pay attention to is the result of a tail, it’s easy to underestimate how rare and powerful they are;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;tail event;86;2023.07.22 20:22
Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was, “The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;military genius;90;2023.07.22 20:28
When you accept that tails drive everything in business, investing, and finance you realize that it’s normal for lots of things to go wrong,break, fail, and fall.If you’re a good stock picker you’ll be right maybe half the time.If you’re a good business leader maybe half of your product and strategy ideas will work.If you’re a good investor most years will be just OK, and plenty will be bad.If you’re a good worker you’ll find the right company in the right field after several attempts and trials.And that’s if you’re good;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;you are good;92;2023.07.22 20:33
It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;when you right when you wrong;95;2023.07.22 20:38
7. FreedomThe highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;highest form of wealth;98;2023.07.23 15:10
People want to become wealthier to make them happier. Happiness isa complicated subject because everyone’s different. But if there’s a common denominator in happiness—a universal fuel of joy—it’s that people want to control their lives.The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want,for as long as you want, is priceless. It is the highest dividend money pays;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;control your life;98;2023.07.23 15:10
Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to give you control over your time. To obtain, bit by bit, a levelof independence and autonomy that comes from unspent assets that give you greater control over what you can do and when you can do it;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;money intrinsic value;99;2023.07.23 15:16
The hardest thing about this was that I loved the work. And I wanted to work hard. But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;love but hate;100;2023.07.23 15:19
People like to feel like they’re in control—in the drivers’ seat. When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;people like to feel control;100;2023.07.23 15:20
Part of what’s happened here is that we’ve used our greater wealth tobuy bigger and better stuff. But we’ve simultaneously given up more control over our time. At best, those things cancel each other out.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;bigger wealth less time;102;2023.07.23 15:23
Rockefeller’s job wasn’t to drill wells, load trains, or move barrels. It was to think and make good decisions. Rockefeller’s product—his deliverable—wasn’t what he did with his hands, or even his words. It was what he figured out inside his head. So that’s where he spent most of his time and energy. Despite sitting quietly most of the day inwhat might have looked like free time or leisure hours to most people, he was constantly working in his mind, thinking problems through;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;working in your mind;103;2023.07.23 15:25
If the operating equipment of the 21st century is a portable device, this means the modern factory is not a place at all. It is the day itself. The computer age has liberated the tools of productivity from the office. Most knowledge workers, whose laptops and smartphones are portable all-purpose media-making machines, can theoretically be as productive at 2 p.m. in the main office as at 2 a.m. in a Tokyo WeWork or at midnight on the couch;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;location productivity;104;2023.07.23 15:27
No one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be happyyou should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want.No one—not a single person—said it’s important to be at least as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more than they doit’s real success.No one—not a single person—said you should choose your work based on your desired future earning power.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;no one said;105;2023.07.23 15:29
What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. “Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them,” Pillemer writes;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;quality;105;2023.07.23 15:30
8. Man in the Car ParadoxWhen you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, “Wow, the guy driving that car is cool.” Instead, you think, “Wow, if I had that car people would think I’m cool.” Subconscious or not, this is how people think;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;guy in a car;108;2023.07.23 18:37
The letter I wrote after my son was born said, “You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration fromother people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect andadmire you.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;you might think;108;2023.07.23 18:38
It’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be respected and admired by others, and using money to buy fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it. Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;admiration and respect;109;2023.07.23 18:40
9. Wealth is What You Don’t SeeSomeone driving a $100,000 car might be wealthy. But the only data point you have about their wealth is that they have $100,000 less than they did before they bought the car (or $100,000 more in debt). That’s all you know about them;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;all you know;112;2023.07.23 18:46
The advisor responded: “Was it really necessary to tell her that if you spend money on things, you will end up with the things and not the money?”³⁰You can laugh, and please do. But the answer is, yes, people do need to be told that. When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to spend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;opposite of being millionare;113;2023.07.23 18:48
It is excellent advice, but it may not go far enough. The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth, it’s the very definition of wealth;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;definition of wealth;113;2023.07.23 18:50
10. Save MoneyThe same is true for incomes. Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want—similar to the gap you get from growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;happier with less money;121;2023.07.25 01:38
Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;past ego;122;2023.07.25 01:40
Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;raise humility;122;2023.07.25 01:40
Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;flexibility is wealth;124;2023.07.25 01:44
Savings in the bank that earn 0% interest might actually generate an extraordinary return if they give you the flexibility to take a job with a lower salary but more purpose, or wait for investment opportunities that come when those without flexibility turn desperate. And that hidden return is becoming more important;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;hidden return;125;2023.07.25 01:47
Intelligence is not a reliable advantage in a world that’s become as connected as ours has.But flexibility is.In a world where intelligence is hyper-competitive and many previous technical skills have become automated, competitive advantages tilt toward nuanced and soft skills—like communication, empathy, and, perhaps most of all, flexibility;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;intelligence vs flexibility;126;2023.07.25 01:49
If you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities, both in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a better chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s necessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who can do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your passion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new routine, a slower pace, and think about life with adifferent set of assumptions. The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;flexibility gives options;126;2023.07.25 01:50
11. Reasonable > RationalI visualized my grief if the stock market went way up and I wasn’t in it—or if it went way down and I was completely in it. My intention was to minimize my future regret. So I split my contributions 50/50 between bonds and equities.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;minimise regret;133;2023.07.25 01:58
Investor Josh Brown, who advocates and mostly owns diversified funds, once explained why he also owns a smattering of individual stocks: “I’m not buying individual stocks because I think I’m going to generate alpha [outperformance]. I just love stocks and have ever since I was 20 years old. And it’s my money, I get to do whatever.” Quite reasonable;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;quite reasonable;137;2023.07.25 02:05
12. Surprise!The problem is that we often use events like the Great Depression and World War II to guide our views of things like worst-case scenarios when thinking about future investment returns. But those record-setting events had no precedent when they occurred. So the forecaster who assumes the worst (and best) events of the past will match theworst (and best) events of the future is not following history, they’re accidentally assuming that the history of unprecedented events doesn’t apply to the future;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;unprecedented events;145;2023.07.25 22:56
Whenever we are surprised by something, even if we admit that we made a mistake, we say, ‘Oh I’ll never make that mistake again.’ But, in fact, what you should learn when you make a mistake because youdid not anticipate something is that the world is difficult to anticipate. That’s the correct lesson to learn from surprises: that the world is surprising;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;world is suprising;146;2023.07.25 22:58
13. Room for ErrorThere is never a moment when you’re so right that you can bet everychip in front of you. The world isn’t that kind to anyone—not consistently, anyways. You have to give yourself room for error. You have toplan on your plan not going according to plan;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;never so right;157;2023.07.25 23:12
Margin of safety—you can also call it room for error or redundancy—is the only effective way to safely navigate a world that is governedby odds, not certainties. And almost everything related to money exists in that kind of world;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;margin of safety;158;2023.07.25 23:14
Two things cause us to avoid room for error. One is the idea that somebody must know what the future holds, driven by the uncomfortable feeling that comes from admitting the opposite. The second is that you’re therefore doing yourself harm by not taking actions that fully exploit an accurate view of that future coming true;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;cause to avoid room for error;159;2023.07.25 23:17
The future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised. “The best way to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie Munger. Wonderful;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;the future might be worse;161;2023.07.25 23:23
The idea is that you have to take risk to get ahead, but no risk that can wipe you out is ever worth taking. The odds are in your favor when playing Russian roulette. But the downside is not worth the potential upside. There is no margin of safety that can compensate for the risk;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;Russian roulette;162;2023.07.25 23:25
I just want to ensure I can remain standing long enough for my risks to pay off. You have to survive to succeed. To repeat a point we’ve made a few times in this book: The ability to do what you want,when you want, for as long as you want, has an infinite ROI.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;survive to succeed;162;2023.07.25 23:27
But these kinds of things happen all the time. You can plan for every risk except the things that are too crazy to cross your mind. And those crazy things can do the most harm, because they happen more often than you think and you have no plan for how to deal with them.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;crazy things do harm;163;2023.07.25 23:30
A good rule of thumb for a lot of things in life is that everything that can break will eventually break. So if many things rely on one thing working, and that thing breaks, you are counting the days to catastrophe. That’s a single point of failure;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;point of failure;165;2023.07.25 23:32
14. You’ll ChangeAn underpinning of psychology is that people are poor forecasters of their future selves.Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;poor forecasters;170;2023.07.27 23:01
The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency forpeople to be keenly aware of how much they’ve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires, and goalsare likely to change in the future.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;history illusion;171;2023.07.27 23:05
All of us,” he said, “are walking around with an illusion—an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives.” We tend to never learn this lesson. Gilbert’s research shows people from age 18 to 68 underestimate how much they will change in the future;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;underestimate change;172;2023.07.27 23:06
We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret. The fuel of the End of History Illusion is that people adapt to most circumstances, so the benefits of an extreme plan—the simplicity of having hardly anything, or the thrill of having almost everything—wear off. But the downsides of those extremes—not being able to afford retirement, or looking back at a life spent devoted to chasing dollars—become enduring regrets. Regrets are especially painful when you abandon a previous plan and feel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast to make up for lost time;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;extremes make regrets;173;2023.07.27 23:10
Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;sunk costs;174;2023.07.27 23:13
Embracing the idea that financial goals made when you were a different person should be abandoned without mercy versus put on life support and dragged on can be a good strategy to minimize future regret;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;good strategy;174;2023.07.27 23:14
15. Nothing’s FreeEvery job looks easy when you’re not the one doing it because the challenges faced by someone in the arena are often invisible to those in the crowd.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;job in the arena;179;2023.07.27 23:16
Like everything else worthwhile, successful investing demands a price. But its currency is not dollars and cents. It’s volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty, and regret—all of which are easy to overlook until you’re dealing with them in real time;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;investing price;179;2023.07.27 23:18
The answer is simple: The price of investing success is not immediately obvious. It’s not a price tag you can see, so when the bill comes due it doesn’t feel like a fee for getting something good. It feels like a fine for doing something wrong. And while people are generally fine with paying fees, fines are supposed to be avoided.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;price of investing;184;2023.07.27 23:26
The trick is convincing yourself that the market’s fee is worth it. That’s the only way to properly deal with volatility and uncertainty—not just putting up with it, but realizing that it’s an admission fee worth paying;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;market fee;185;2023.07.27 23:29
16. You & MeMany finance and investment decisions are rooted in watching what other people do and either copying them or betting against them. But when you don’t knowwhy someone behaves like they do you won’t know how long they’ll continue acting that way, what will make them change their mind, or whether they’ll ever learn their lesson;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;rooted in watching;195;2023.07.28 16:46
A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are.The main thing I can recommend is going out of your way to identify what game you’re playing;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;different game than you are;196;2023.07.28 16:49
17. The Seduction of PessimismOptimism is the best bet for most people because the world tends to get better for most people most of the time.But pessimism holds a special place in our hearts. Pessimism isn’t justmore common than optimism. It also sounds smarter. It’s intellectually captivating, and it’s paid more attention than optimism, which is often viewed as being oblivious to risk;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;optimism n pessimism;199;2023.08.02 22:45
Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. The simple idea that most people wake up in the morning trying to make things a little better and more productive than wake up looking to cause trouble is the foundation of optimism;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;optimism;199;2023.08.02 22:47
When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains. This asymmetry between the power of positive andnegative expectations or experiences has an evolutionary history. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;losses n gains;204;2023.08.02 23:13
A third is that progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore. There are lots of overnight tragedies. There are rarely overnight miracles.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;tragedies n miracles;207;2023.08.02 23:20
Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that feels flat.Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about.Maybe that’s why it’s so seductive. Expecting things to be bad is the best way to be pleasantly surprised when they’re not.Which, ironically, is something to be optimistic about;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;optimistic pessimism;211;2023.08.02 23:27
18. When You’ll Believe AnythingThere are many things in life that we think are true because we desperately want them to be true.I call these things “appealing fictions.” They have a big impact on how we think about money—particularly investments and the economy;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;want to be true;217;2023.08.03 23:43
These may be low-probability bets. The problem is that viewers can’t,or don’t, calibrate low odds, like a 1% chance. Many default to a firmbelief that what they want to be true is unequivocally true. But they’re only doing that because the possibility of a huge outcome exists;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;low prob bets;219;2023.08.04 08:51
Investing is one of the only fields that offers daily opportunities for extreme rewards. People believe in financial quackery in a way they never would for, say, weather quackery because the rewards for correctly predicting what the stock market will do next week are in a different universe than the rewards for predicting whether it will be sunny or rainy next week;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;extreme rewards;219;2023.08.04 08:51
The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;the bigger the gap;220;2023.08.04 08:53
If you think a recession is coming and you cash out your stocks in anticipation, your view of the economy is suddenly going to be warped by what you want to happen. Every blip, every anecdote, will look like a sign that doom has arrived—maybe not because it has, but because you want it to;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;because you want it too;221;2023.08.04 08:56
Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;incomplete view;221;2023.08.04 08:56
Even at a year old, she’s written her own internal narrative of how everything works. Blankets keep you warm, mom snuggles keep you safe, and dates taste good.Everything she comes across fits into one of a few dozen mental models she’s learned. When I go to work she doesn’t stop in confusion, wondering what salary and bills are. She has a crystal clear explanation of the situation: Dad isn’t playing with me, and I wanted him to play with me, so I’m sad.Even though she knows little, she doesn’t realize it, because she tells herself a coherent story about what’s going on based on the little she does know.All of us, no matter our age, do the same thing;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;1 year old;222;2023.08.04 08:58
Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makessense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;past gives illusion;223;2023.08.04 09:02
Most people, when confronted with something they don’t understand, do not realize they don’t understand it because they’re able to come up with an explanation that makes sense based on their own unique perspective and experiences in the world, however limited those experiences are. We all want the complicated world we live in to make sense. So we tell ourselves stories to fill in the gaps of what are effectively blind spots;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;stories that blind;223;2023.08.04 09:04
Part of the reason forecasting the stock market and the economy is so hard is because you are the only person in the world who thinks the world operates the way you do;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;forecasting is hard;224;2023.08.04 09:07
Coming to terms with how much you don’t know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;accept out of control;224;2023.08.04 09:13
Carl Richards writes: “Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;risk;224;2023.08.04 09:14
Psychologist Philip Tetlock once wrote: “We need to believe we live ina predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;need to believe;224;2023.08.04 09:14
Wanting to believe we arein control is an emotional itch that needs to be scratched, rather thanan analytical problem to be calculated and solved. The illusion of control is more persuasive than the reality of uncertainty. So we clingto stories about outcomes being in our control.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;control vs uncertanity;225;2023.08.04 09:17
We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;focus n neglect;226;2023.08.04 09:20
19. All Together NowI can’t tell you what to do with your money, because I don’t know you.I don’t know what you want. I don’t know when you want it. I don’t know why you want it;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;I don't know;232;2023.08.13 15:07
Go out of your way to find humility when things are going right and forgiveness/compassion when they go wrong. Because it’s never as good or as bad as it looks. The world is big and complex. Luck and risk are both real and hard to identify. Do so when judging both yourself and others. Respect the power of luck and risk and you’ll have a better chance of focusing on things you can actually control. You’ll also have a better chance of finding the right role models.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;luck, risk and humility;233;2023.08.13 15:09
Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will never build wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can have with your money right now, today;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;less ego more wealth;233;2023.08.13 15:11
Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night. That’s different from saying you should aim to earn the highest returns or savea specific percentage of your income. Some people won’t sleep well unless they’re earning the highest returns, others will only get a goodrest if they’re conservatively invested. To each their own. But the foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universalguidepost for all financial decisions;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;sleep at night;233;2023.08.13 15:12
Become OK with a lot of things going wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things account for the majority of outcomes. No matter what you’re doing with your money you should be comfortable with a lot of stuff not working. That’s just how the world is. So you should always measure how you’ve done by looking at your full portfolio, rather than individual investments. It is fine to have a large chunk of poor investments and a few outstanding ones. That’s usually the best-case scenario. Judging how you’ve done by focusing on individual investments makes winners look more brilliant than they were, and losers appear more regrettable than they should;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;be OK with wrong;234;2023.08.13 15:14
Use money to gain control over your time, because not having controlof your time is such a powerful and universal drag on happiness. The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want,for as long as you want to, pays the highest dividend that exists in finance.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;money to get control of your time;234;2023.08.13 15:15
Be nicer and less flashy. No one is impressed with your possessions asmuch as you are. You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. But what you probably want is respect and admiration. And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;admiration thru kindness;234;2023.08.13 15:16
Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises. Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;save for no reason;234;2023.08.13 15:17
Define the cost of success and be ready to pay it. Because nothing worthwhile is free. And remember that most financial costs don’t have visible price tags. Uncertainty, doubt, and regret are common costs in the finance world. They’re often worth paying. But you have to view them as fees (a price worth paying to get something nice in exchange) rather than fines (a penalty you should avoid).;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;cost of success;235;2023.08.13 15:18
Worship room for error. A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;room for error, endurance;235;2023.08.13 15:19
Avoid the extreme ends of financial decisions. Everyone’s goals and desires will change over time, and the more extreme your past decisions were the more you may regret them as you evolve.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;avoid extremes;235;2023.08.13 15:20
You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;like risk and be paranoid;235;2023.08.13 15:21
Define the game you’re playing, and make sure your actions are not being influenced by people playing a different game.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;different games;235;2023.08.13 15:22
Respect the mess. Smart, informed, and reasonable people can disagree in finance, because people have vastly different goals and desires. There is no single right answer, just the answer that works for you;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;respect the mess;235;2023.08.13 15:23
20. ConfessionsI love this question because it highlights what can often be a mile-wide gap between what makes sense—which is what people suggest you do—and what feels right to them—which is what they actually do;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;what do you own and why;238;2023.08.19 13:38
Charlie Munger once said “I did not intend to get rich. I just wanted to get independent.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;get independent;239;2023.08.19 13:41
I mostly just want to wake up every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;do whatever you want;240;2023.08.19 13:42
Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It means you only do the work youlike with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;independence;240;2023.08.19 13:44
It’s mostly a matter of keeping your expectations in check and living below your means. Independence, at any income level, is driven by your savings rate. And past a certain level of income your savings rate is driven by your ability to keep your lifestyleexpectations from running away.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;keep from runnnin away;240;2023.08.19 13:44
If there’s a part of our household financial plan I’m proud of it’s that we got the goalpost of lifestyle desires to stop moving at a young age. Our savings rate is fairly high, but we rarely feel like we’re repressively frugal because our aspirations for more stuff haven’t moved much. It’s not that our aspirations are nonexistent—we like nice stuff and live comfortably. We just got the goalpost to stop moving;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;stop goal post;241;2023.08.19 13:46
it only works for us because we both agree to it equally—neither of us are compromising for the other. Most of what we get pleasure from—going for walks, reading, podcasts—costs little, so we rarely feel like we’re missing out;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;get pleasure;241;2023.08.19 13:47
Comfortably living below what you can afford, without much desire for more, removes a tremendous amount of social pressure that many people in the modern first world subject themselves to. Nassim Taleb explained: “True success is exiting some rat race to modulate one’s activities for peace of mind.” I like that;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;exit rat race;241;2023.08.19 13:48
The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels betterthan maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel independent.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;independence rather than financial gain;242;2023.08.19 13:49
But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters. Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being “right.”;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;be happy or be right;242;2023.08.19 13:51
The few people who know the details of our finances ask, “What are you saving for? A house? A boat? A new car?” No, none of those. I’m saving for a world where curveballs are more common than we expect;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;saving for the world;243;2023.08.19 13:53
If you can meet all your goals without having to take the added risk that comes from trying to outperform the market, then what’s the point of even trying? I can afford to not be the greatest investor in the world, but I can’t afford to be a bad one.;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;don't have to be the greatest but dont want bad;244;2023.08.19 13:57
It doesn’t need to be more complicated than that for us. I like it simple. One of my deeply held investing beliefs is that there is little correlation between investment effort and investment results;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;little correlation;245;2023.08.19 14:00
No matter how we save or invest I’m sure we’ll always have the goal of independence, and we’ll always do whatever maximizes for sleeping well at night;Psychology_of_money;Morgan_Housel;;sleep well at night;245;2023.08.19 14:01
