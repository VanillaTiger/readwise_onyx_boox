5. Last Mover AdvantageFor a company to be valuable it must grow and endure, but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth. They have an excuse: growth is easy to measure, but durability isn’t;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;growth vs durability;40;2023.04.27 23:57

Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.This isn’t a list of boxes to check as you build your business—there’s no shortcut to monopoly. However, analyzing your business according to these characteristics can help you think about how to make it durable.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;characteristics of monopoly;41;2023.04.28 00:01

Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one.

If you think of yourself as an insurgent battling dark forces, it’s easy to become unduly fixated on the obstacles in your path.

But since we expanded the market for payments overall, we gave Visa far more business than we took.

You’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into a market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get started. But moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It’s much better to be the last mover—that is, to make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits. The way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from there,toward your ambitious long-term vision. In this one particular at least, business is like chess.

The indefiniteness of finance can be bizarre. Think about what happens when successful entrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money?

, it’s important to everybody because everybody is an investor. An entrepreneur makes a major investment just by spending her time working on a startup.

Fourth is “flatness.” As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one homogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” Given that assumption, anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it already?

"There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural secrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of thephysical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know.

9. FoundationsThiel’s law”: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;Thiel law;89;2023.05.09 23:49
Companies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on—if you choosethe wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example—are very hard to correct afterthey are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before anybody will eventry to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first things right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;first things right;89;2023.05.09 23:52
Now when I consider investing in a startup, I study the founding teams. Technical abilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each other and how well they work together matter just as much. Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together—otherwise they’re just rolling dice;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;founders should know each other;90;2023.05.14 23:42
You need good people who get along, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone aligned for the long term.To anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to distinguish between three concepts:• Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity?• Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?• Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;three concepts of misalignment;91;2023.05.14 23:46
Unlike corporate giants, early-stage startups are small enough that founders usually have both ownership and possession. Most conflicts in a startup erupt between ownership and control—that is, between founders and investors on the board. The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board member might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for his venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the business;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;misalignment in early startups;92;2023.05.14 23:50

"ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUSAs a general rule, everyone you involve with your company should be involved full-time. Sometimes you’ll have to break this rule; it usually makes sense to hire outside lawyers and accountants, for example. However, anyone who doesn’t own stock options or drawa regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned";Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;misalignment of future gains;94;2023.05.14 23:55
nullFor people to be fully committed, they should be properly compensated. Whenever an entrepreneur asks me to invest in his company, I ask him how much he intends to pay himself. A company does better the less it pays the CEO—that’s one of the single clearest patterns I’ve noticed from investing in hundreds of startups. In no case should a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per year in salary.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;better when paid less;95;2023.05.14 23:58
9. FoundationsIf a CEO collects $300,000 per year, he risks becoming more like a politician than a founder. High pay incentivizes him to defend the status quo along with his salary, not to work with everyone else to surface problems and fix them aggressively. A cash-poor executive, by contrast, will focus on increasing the value of the company as a whole.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;CEO as politician and status quo;95;2023.05.14 23:59
Every employee noticed his obvious commitment to the company’s mission and emulated it. If a CEO doesn’t set an exampleby taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by drawing the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective ceiling on cash compensation.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;CEO as example;95;2023.05.15 00:01
However, high cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it already exists instead of investing their time to create new value in the future. A cash bonus is slightly better than a cash salary—at least it’s contingent on a job well done. But even so-called incentive pay encourages short-term thinking and value grabbing. Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;cash is present not future;95;2023.05.15 00:02
Equity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations. Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for the long term and a commitment to increasing your company’s value in the future. Equity can’t create perfect incentives, but it’s the best way for a founder to keep everyone in the company broadly aligned.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;equity is powerful tool;96;2023.05.15 00:06
The most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is most characteristic of beginnings. This leads to a second, less obvious understanding of the founding: it lasts as long as a company is creating new things, and it ends when creation stops. If you get the founding moment right, you can do more than create a valuable company: you can steer its distant future toward the creation of new things insteadof the stewardship of inherited success;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;most valuable company;97;2023.05.15 00:10
"10. The Mechanics of MafiaIt includes some of the absurd perks Silicon Valley has made famous, but none of the substance—and without substance perks don’t work.You can’t accomplish anything meaningful by hiring an interior decorator to beautify your office, a “human resources” consultant to fix your policies, or a branding specialist to hone your buzzwords. “Company culture” doesn’t exist apart from the company itself:no company has a culture; every company is a culture.

But taking a merelyprofessional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it’s not even rational.

However, even a great mission is not enough. The kind of recruit who would be most engaged as an employee will also wonder: “Are these the kind of people I want to work with?” You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally.

Now that millions of Chinese peasants can finally enjoy a secure supply of basic calories, they want more of them tocome from pork instead of just grain.

men and machines are good at fundamentally different things. People have intentionality—we form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We’re less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing, but they struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;men and machines different at fundamentally different things;121;2023.05.19 05:50
2012, one of their supercomputers made headlines when, after scanning 10 million thumbnails of YouTube videos, it learned to identify a cat with 75% accuracy. That seems impressive—until you remember that an average four-year-old can do it flawlessly. When a cheap laptop beats the smartest mathematicians at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs can’t beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful than each other—they’re categorically different.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;computer can't beat a child;121;2023.05.19 05:52
The stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working with computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people. We don’t trade with computers any more than we trade with livestock or lamps;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;gains working with computer;121;2023.05.19 05:54
The fraudsters’ adaptive evasions fooled our automatic detection algorithms, but we found that they didn’t fool our human analysts as easily. So Max and his engineers rewrote the software to take a hybrid approach: the computer would flag the most suspicious transactions on a well-designed user interface, and human operators would make the final judgment as to their legitimacy;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;hybrid approach;123;2023.05.19 06:00
I continued to think about this after we sold PayPal in 2002: if humans and computers together could achieve dramatically better results than either could attain alone, what other valuable businesses could be built on this core principle?;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;achieve together;123;2023.05.19 06:01
"Doctors need to marry clinical understanding with an ability to communicate it to non-expert patients. And good teachers aren’t just experts in their disciplines: they must also understand how totailor their instruction to different individuals’ interests and learning styles.

big data.” Today’s companies have an insatiable appetite for data, mistakenly believing that more data always creates more value. But big data is usually dumb data.

We’re impressed with small feats accomplished by computers alone, but we ignore big achievements from complementarity because the human contribution makes them less uncanny. Watson, Deep Blue, and ever-better machine learning algorithms arecool. But the most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;machine complementary to humans;126;2023.05.19 06:16
"Technology is supposed to increase our mastery over nature and reduce the role of chance in our lives; building smarter-than-human computers could actually bring chance back with a vengeance.

13. Seeing GreenMost cleantech companies crashed because they neglected one or more of the seven questions that every business must answer:1. The Engineering QuestionCan you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?2. The Timing QuestionIs now the right time to start your particular business?3. The Monopoly QuestionAre you starting with a big share of a small market?4. The People QuestionDo you have the right team?5.

Exaggerating your own uniqueness is an easy way to botch the monopoly question. Suppose you’re running a solar company that’s successfully installed hundreds of solar panel systems with a combined power generation capacity of 100 megawatts. Since total U.S. solar energy production capacity is 950 megawatts, you own 10.53% of the market.

Energy problems are engineering problems, so you would expect to find nerds running cleantech companies. You’d be wrong: the ones that failed were run by shockingly nontechnical teams.

14. The Founder’s ParadoxBut that doesn’t capture the strangest thing about founders. Normally we expect opposite traits to be mutually exclusive: a normal person can’t be both rich and poor at thesame time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders: startup CEOs can be cash poor but millionaires on paper. They may oscillate between sullen jerkiness and appealing charisma. Almost all successful entrepreneurs are simultaneously insiders and outsiders. And when they do succeed, they attract both fame and infamy;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;the difference of founders;152;2023.05.21 22:41
This hints at the strange way in which the companies that create new technology often resemble feudal monarchies rather than organizations that are supposedly more “modern.” A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong personal loyalty,and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal bureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but they usually act with short time horizons;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;feudal monarchies companies;163;2023.05.21 23:03

Above all, don’t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are important not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather because a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;great founders brings best in people;163;2023.05.21 23:05
"Conclusion: Stagnation or Singularity?If we define the future as a time that looks different from the present, then most people aren’t expecting any future at all; instead, they expect coming decades to bring moreglobalization, convergence, and sameness. In this scenario, poorer countries will catchup to richer countries, and the world as a whole will reach an economic plateau. But even if a truly globalized plateau were possible, could it last? In the best case, economic competition would be more intense than ever before for every single person and firm on the planet";Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;if you define feature;166;2023.05.21 23:12
Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to think for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to the ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.;Zero to One;Peter Thiel;;our task today;167;2023.05.21 23:15
